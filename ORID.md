Objective: Today, I started learning the React framework. I found myself unfamiliar with React's syntax and had not systematically studied it before.

Reflective: I feel that writing React code is quite difficult, mainly because I am not familiar with it yet. This makes me a bit frustrated 
        because I hope to master it quickly. At the same time, I also feel a bit anxious, worried that if I don't learn well, it will affect the progress of my projects.

Interpretive: My difficulties mainly stem from unfamiliarity with React's syntax and a lack of systematic learning. 
        This indicates that I may need to find better learning resources, such as online tutorials or programming courses

Decisional: To improve my learning outcomes, I will schedule fixed times each day to study React, including reading official documentation and watching tutorial videos.
        In addition, I will start a small project to practice what I have learned, especially regarding inter-component communication and routing, to deepen my understanding through practice.
